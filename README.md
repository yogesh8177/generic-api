# Generic api

(Rough sketch v1)

Note: All logic is blocking, i.e validation is blocking, can be changed to async pattern too!

# Important files:

```constants.js contains example config for a resource```
-- You can create new instance of generic-api for different resources. A resource in this context refers to an entity like User, Car, Product etc.

# Steps to run

- Inside root directory do ```node server.js```
